# Deadly-Divide--Power-BI-Analysis
For any power BI dashboard, we have to follow the basic steps of data understanding and data cleaning. so for this project i have started with collecting the dataset and had to understand every other features. I will talk about the dataset in further steps, but lets first understand Power BI and how it is so impactful on a dataset analysis and how it eases your life for some tasks.
Power BI is one of the most used visualization tools compared to tablue or excel dax, etc. It is often preferred in Microsoft-heavy environments. The steps of making a Power BI dashboard include the following steps:
→ Data understanding.
→ Clarify the Goal of the project/ Defining the requirements.
→ Clean and transform the data.
→ Model the Data - Create relationships within the tables.
→ Build Visuals on Report Pages and make summaries.
→ Make it look so Pretty.
→ Create minimal number of dashboards and convey the information.
Lets talk about each of above perspectives. It is often advised to make all the summaries using the dashboard pages in lesser pages so it is more crisp and understandable and the reviewer don't have to be looking through the numerous pages in a project. 
Most important part in this whole process is Understanding the data and then sticking to the main project goal and the data processing in a way. If you don't know the business question you're solving, your visuals will be random or confusing. Always ask yourself "What do we want to know, and why?" doing this for any data will get you proper understanding of the project statement.
"Bad Data = Bad Dashboard". Even a pretty dashboard is useless if the data behind it is incomplete or misunderstood. This includes Cleaning the raw data, Making relationships between the tables, Making new useful Measures using DAX. If you goal is clear and data is clean, the visuals and interactivity is much smoother and more effective.
How does making relationships between data tables make it better?? We usually make relationships between the columns which are existing in common. It could be a ID number, Location ID or even Location names in our case. When tables are related, selecting a filter (like a product name or region) in a slicer automatically filters the data correctly across all related visuals. That means if you put a filter in the first dashboard page, the filter will be applied through all the visuals that you have for the rest of the document where the data is used.
In the visuals section in the power BI, we find various types of graphs like Bar/Column charts, Line chart, Area chart, Filled map, Scatter chart, Funnel Map, Histogram, Card, KPI card, Pie chart, Doughnut chart. The type of representation we need for that type of data we can decide which of the graphs to use. To perform advanced analysis we can also import some more custom visuals from Microsoft store. 
For example to make Trends we can use Line chart, Comparison → Bar chart, Distribution → Histogram or Box Plot, Composition → Pie, Donut, Treemap, Relationships → Scatter, Drilldowns → Decomposition Tree or Matrix.
In our analysis i have used few basic visualizations like a Card, KPI card, Slicer, Pie chart, Filled map chart and two types of bar/column charts.
